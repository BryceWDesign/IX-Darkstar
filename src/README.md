# IX-Darkstar /src/ – Control Code & System Logic

This folder will contain firmware, simulation stubs, and embedded control logic for the IX-Darkstar propulsion unit. Although the IX-Darkstar engine operates without traditional fuel or chemical thrust, it requires precise control over internal oscillations, rebound sequencing, and energy management.

## 🌐 Modules to Be Added

### 1. ⏱️ Oscillation Timing Controller  
A software module that triggers electromagnetic pulses at defined intervals to initiate or maintain movement of the floating core inside the tube. May include:

- Pulse width modulation (PWM)
- Adjustable duty cycle
- Vacuum-optimized timing delays

### 2. ⚡ Induction Harvesting Interface  
Handles feedback from piezoelectric or triboelectric systems on each impact. Converts analog voltage signals into usable telemetry.

- Signal smoothing / filtering
- Peak detection and efficiency tracking
- Logging & onboard storage stub

### 3. 🧭 Motion Bias Gate (optional)  
Experimental code to introduce asymmetry in rebound strength or angle via microsecond timing offsets — for directional drift.

- Left/right timing variation
- Delay gate injection
- Phase shift experiments

## 💾 Planned Languages

- Embedded C / PlatformIO (for hardware interface)
- Python / NumPy (for simulation & prototyping)
- Optional Rust or C++ for high-performance core loop

---

## 🛠️ Build Targets (Future)

- STM32F401 / STM32G4 Discovery
- ESP32-S3
- Teensy 4.1
- Desktop Simulator (Python)
