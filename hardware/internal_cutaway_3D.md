# IX-Darkstar Internal Cutaway (3D Layered System Description)

This document provides a layer-by-layer breakdown of the core engine architecture of the IX-Darkstar space propulsion system, allowing engineers and reviewers to mentally visualize the internal layout prior to full 3D modeling or CAD rendering.

## 🔁 Overview

IX-Darkstar operates as a sealed, modularized energy-conversion engine built on reciprocating magnetic flux and rebound energy harvesting. The cutaway below is conceptual and not to physical scale but is derived from measured ratios of field tests.

## 🧩 Layered System Breakdown

### 🔹 Layer 1: Outer Thermal Shell
- Titanium alloy shell with boron nitride internal spray
- MLI foil wrapping external surfaces
- Functions: Impact resistance, radiation shielding, passive temperature control

### 🔹 Layer 2: Mount Rails and Struts
- Sorbothane damped carbon-fiber rails suspended from shell
- Direct connection to field coil chambers via modular clips
- Shock-isolated for microgravity harmonic shielding

### 🔹 Layer 3: Pulse Driver Rings
- Concentric rings (3–5 total depending on model)
- Each ring contains 12 to 36 neodymium supercoil windings
- Configured in magnetic pairs for alternating pulse field polarity
- Force vectors carefully aligned toward rebound chamber center

### 🔹 Layer 4: Flux Recirculation & Capacitor Loops
- Torus-mounted supercapacitor arrays (graphene + ceramic)
- Links to high-current switching bus (GaN transistors)
- Power harvesting diodes feed surplus back to onboard batteries

### 🔹 Layer 5: Rebound Core Chamber
- Internally floating ferromagnetic slug (coated for non-adhesion)
- Oscillates at high frequency (2–9 Hz standard)
- Surrounded by levitation flux and pulse coils
- Kinetic harvesters embedded at endcaps to capture mechanical rebound

### 🔹 Layer 6: Sensor Lattice and Control Core
- 3-axis IMUs, magnetic flux monitors, coil temperature sensors
- Core MCU based on radiation-hardened ARM Cortex-M7 or RISC-V equivalent
- Logic powered via redundant DC microbuses from pulse recovery circuits

## 🧠 Control System Note

The coil switching is software-defined and dynamically altered via flux feedback and motion data. Unlike traditional engines, no combustion or pressure differentials exist — propulsion is achieved through electromagnetic rebound and harvesting asymmetry.

## 🛰 Final Remarks

This architecture is designed for redundancy, energy-loop feedback, and survivability in deep-space environments with no atmosphere, little to no friction, and radiation risk.

A CAD version of this cutaway will be provided in a later release.
