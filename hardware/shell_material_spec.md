## ðŸ§± Primary Shell Material

- Material: Titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V (Grade 5)
- Thickness: 2.5 mm external shell, 1.5 mm internal subframe
- Mass efficiency: High strength-to-weight ratio
- Melting point: ~1,660Â°C
- Yield strength: 880â€“950 MPa
- Benefits:
  - Non-magnetic
  - Highly corrosion-resistant
  - Radiation-hardened
  - Low thermal expansion

## ðŸ›¡ Radiation Shielding Layer

To minimize degradation from solar and cosmic radiation:

- Material: Boron nitride (BN) or polyethylene composite
- Thickness: 3 mm inner coating
- Application: Spray-bonded lining on all crew-proximal or electronics-bearing panels
- Purpose:
  - Blocks high-energy protons and electrons (primary solar threat)
  - Provides partial shielding against galactic cosmic rays (GCRs)
  - Protects control logic and capacitor arrays from single-event upsets (SEUs)

## ðŸ”¥ Thermal Insulation Layer

- Material: Multi-layer insulation (MLI)
- Composition: Alternating mylar and dacron netting (12 layers)
- Purpose: Minimize radiation gain/loss
- Installed as: External wrapping on all side panels, especially radiator-facing

---

## ðŸŒ€ Vibration Damping Interfaces

Due to high-G internal magnetic rebounds:

- Material: Sorbothane polymer dampers + carbon fiber mechanical struts
- Mounting: Between magnetic rail system and frame
- Purpose: Prevent harmonic amplification and frame fatigue

---

## âš™ Assembly Features

- Frame constructed from interlocking CNC titanium plates
- Modular fastening points for sensor rails and petal radiators
- Surface texture: Laser-etched for emissivity enhancement and stealth profile

---

## ðŸ“¦ Payload and Electronics Enclosure

- Internal bay uses carbon-fiber sub-housing
- EMI shielding via Faraday mesh of copper-coated polyamide weave
- Hermetically sealed wiring tunnels between coils and capacitor banks
