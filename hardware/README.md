## 1. System Architecture Summary

The IX-Darkstar propulsion engine consists of the following primary hardware modules:

- **Thermal Shell and Housing:**  
  High-strength titanium alloy shell with multilayer insulation (MLI) and boron nitride coatings for radiation shielding and thermal control.

- **Magnetic Pulse Driver Array:**  
  Concentric superconducting coil rings configured to generate rapid magnetic pulses, driving the rebound core oscillations.

- **Rebound Core Assembly:**  
  Magnetically levitated, coated ferromagnetic mass inside the pulse tube, oscillating via electromagnetic forces to produce kinetic energy conversion.

- **Power Electronics and Capacitors:**  
  Graphene-enhanced supercapacitors and GaN transistor-based high-current switching units manage pulse power delivery and energy recovery.

- **Control and Sensor Suite:**  
  Radiation-hardened ARM Cortex-M7 (or RISC-V equivalent) MCU handles coil timing, feedback loops, and system telemetry via integrated sensor arrays.

- **Thermal Management System:**  
  Passive radiative cooling panels, embedded heat pipes, phase change materials (PCMs), and active thermal cycling maintain stable operating temperatures.

## 2. Integration Notes

- **Mechanical Assembly:**  
  Modular construction allows for disassembly and replacement of pulse coils and rebound core components. Shock absorption via Sorbothane damped carbon-fiber rails reduces mechanical stress.

- **Electrical Interfaces:**  
  Pulse driver coils are connected in parallel with power electronics via high-current bus bars. Redundant pathways ensure fail-safe operation.

- **Software Control:**  
  Firmware adjusts pulse frequency and coil timing dynamically based on feedback from magnetic flux sensors and IMUs to maintain optimal oscillation amplitude.

- **Thermal Pathways:**  
  Heat pipes connect high-loss components to external radiative panels. MLI blankets minimize thermal leaks.
