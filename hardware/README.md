## ðŸ”© Core Components

| Component                  | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rebound Tube Assembly     | Primary vacuum-sealed axis for magnetic oscillation and asymmetry effects   |
| Coil Stack & Induction    | Solenoids and electromagnetic gates for guiding rebound force vectoring     |
| Levitation Rails          | Non-contact magnetic stasis for central mass guidance                       |
| Kinetic Core Mass         | Heavy composite core designed to bounce and recapture energy magnetically   |
| End-Contact Plates        | Ultra-reactive material interfaces to reverse or enhance impact force       |
| Energy Capture Rings      | Induction plates to scavenge electromagnetic recovery during oscillation    |
| Cap Banks & Drivers       | Power storage and release modules (capacitor arrays, fast-discharge loops)  |
| Structural Housing        | Vacuum-stable shell for mounting components and minimizing recoil loss      |
