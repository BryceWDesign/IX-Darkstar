## 1. Heat Generation Sources

- **Pulse driver coils:** High current electromagnetic pulses generate resistive heating.
- **Rebound core:** Mechanical oscillations induce frictional and eddy current heat.
- **Control electronics:** MCU, sensors, and power electronics produce operational heat.

## 2. Thermal Environment Challenges

- **No convective cooling:** Space vacuum prevents heat transfer by air or liquid convection.
- **Limited radiative surfaces:** Radiative heat transfer is the only viable cooling mechanism.
- **Variable thermal loads:** Pulsed power cycles create fluctuating heat dissipation demands.

## 3. Cooling and Dissipation Mechanisms

### 3.1 Multilayer Insulation (MLI) and Heat Shielding

- Outer shell is wrapped with MLI blankets composed of alternating layers of aluminized Mylar and Dacron mesh.
- Minimizes external heat loss and shields sensitive electronics from cosmic rays.

### 3.2 High Emissivity Radiative Panels

- Strategically placed panels coated with high-emissivity materials (e.g., blackened carbon nanotube composites) maximize thermal radiation into space.
- Panels are thermally connected to the inner core via heat pipes made of carbon fiber composites.

### 3.3 Internal Heat Pipes and Phase Change Materials (PCM)

- Embedded heat pipes circulate heat from hotspots to radiative surfaces.
- PCMs (such as paraffin wax composites) absorb peak heat surges by phase transitions, releasing heat steadily over time.

### 3.4 Active Thermal Management

- Temperature sensors embedded throughout the engine provide real-time data.
- The MCU dynamically adjusts pulse frequencies and power output to optimize thermal load.
- Cooling cycles are integrated into the pulse driver timing to allow controlled cooldown periods.
