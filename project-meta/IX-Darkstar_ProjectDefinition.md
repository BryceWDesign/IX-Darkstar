## Objective

To publicly demonstrate a constrained but technically plausible concept of zero-fuel, momentum-cycled propulsion using internal mass shift, magnetic rebound, and self-inducing kinetic charge loops ‚Äî suitable for theoretical application in vacuum conditions such as space.

## Core Principles

- üîÅ‚ÄØCyclic Momentum Conversion  
- üß≤‚ÄØMagnetically Isolated Linear Oscillation  
- ‚ö°‚ÄØInduction from Rebound Displacement  
- üõë‚ÄØNo External Mass Ejection (non-rocket)

## Functional Summary

The device envisions a levitated ferromagnetic core oscillating within a tube. Rebound zones at each end are composed of highly reactive, non-destructive transfer materials that act as both induction points and oscillation limiters. Kinetic movement ‚Äî initiated externally or via pulse ‚Äî creates a feedback loop of minor charge capture and motion amplification.

It is not intended to demonstrate perpetual motion ‚Äî rather, a high-efficiency recovery loop to be leveraged as a thruster trigger or energy-buffered oscillator for small-force actuation.
