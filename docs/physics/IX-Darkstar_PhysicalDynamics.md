## 🚀 Core Propulsion Hypothesis

IX-Darkstar proposes a closed-loop, zero-fuel propulsion architecture based on asymmetric internal motion and rebounding mass distribution in a vacuum. It does not expel propellant, but instead exploits internal kinematics and induced force redistribution over time.

## 🧩 Components Considered

- Ferrite or neodymium core (magnetically suspended)
- Vacuum-sealed oscillation chamber (with induction layers at each end)
- Magnetic levitation & rebound zones
- Piezoelectric or triboelectric harvesting layer
- Optional: Electromagnetic pulser ring for input energy burst

## 📐 Motion and Force Transfer

1. A ferromagnetic core is levitated and free to oscillate in a tube.
2. When it rebounds between end caps:
   - Kinetic energy is partially captured via induction.
   - Magnetic asymmetry or pulsed timing gates may bias its return path.
3. In a frictionless (vacuum) environment, oscillations persist longer.
4. When properly gated (electronically or mechanically), timing offsets cause non-uniform impulse on the mounting structure.
5. Result: Slight net force exerted in a single direction — repeatable over many cycles.

## 📈 Equations (Simplified)

Let:
- m = mass of oscillating core  
- v = velocity of core at midpoint  
- B = magnetic field strength at poles  
- A = area of impact zone  
- τ = rebound time interval  
- F = net internal force per cycle  
- η = energy recovery efficiency  

Total extracted energy per impact (theoretical upper limit):

> Eₑ = ½·m·v²·η

Induced current from rebound compression (in ideal coil system):

> I = (dΦ/dt) = N·A·(dB/dt)

Asymmetry of induced energy per half-cycle can result in slight net force vector:

> Fₙet = (Δp) / τ

Where Δp is directional momentum imbalance introduced by controlled damping or rebound shaping.

## 🌀 Vacuum Behavior

- In near-zero atmosphere, frictional losses are negligible.
- Oscillations sustain longer and result in higher efficiency rebound.
- Magnetic biasing can be used to “tilt” equilibrium slightly.

---

## 🧠 Summary

This model does not violate thermodynamic law but instead attempts to generate movement using:
- Internal reactive rebound
- Pulse gating
- Magnetic asymmetry
- Induction harvesting

In aggregate, thousands of micro-impulses may lead to macroscopic drift or thrust.
