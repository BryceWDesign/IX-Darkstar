## Overview

This document outlines the internal loop mechanism at a conceptual level, describing how oscillatory motion and rebound induction may be used to simulate net propulsion or usable charge in a vacuum.

[End Cap B]

- The ◉ Ferrite Core is suspended magnetically in a near-frictionless track.
- End Cap A and End Cap B are coated with a high-reactivity induction material.
- Motion between caps allows for energy harvesting (kinetic-to-electrical).
- Mechanical or electromagnetic pulsing may be applied to sustain oscillation.
- In vacuum conditions, inertial loss is minimized and rebound is efficient.
- When the motion stabilizes asymmetrically (with timed gating), directional force can emerge.

## Rebound Material Spec (General)

Ideal materials for the rebound interface:

- Ultra-high reaction induction alloys (e.g., modified Terfenol-D variants)
- Soft-layered impact-absorbing composites with piezoelectric layer
- Electrically gated repulsion actuators for motion shaping

## Engineering Note

This model assumes no fuel or propellant and instead relies on internal energy redirection. It does not violate conservation of momentum but instead attempts to exploit internal asymmetry via staged energy harvesting and controlled reflection patterns.
